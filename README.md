# todo-app
  
  ## Description
  I wanted to make a bigger project with using module pattern and webpack. I decided to make a todoApp. It took me couple of days to finish the project. Probably the hardest project that I ever made until today. But I am happy that it works and I generally included features that are in my mind when I started to make. After I added all the features I decided to learn Local Storage. And added Local Storage feature as well.
  ## What I Learnt

  <br>
  3- Function Constructor,arrays and object(in more detail).

  4- OOP in javascript in more detail.

  5- Before diving into the code, planning how I want to organize project.
